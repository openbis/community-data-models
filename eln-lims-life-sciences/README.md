# LIFE SCIENCES MASTER DATA

## Background
This master data has been developed at the ETHZ by SIS in collaboration with researchers.   
Until openBIS 20.10.7, this was included as plugin in the openBIS builds.  
Now users who wish to use life science types, can upload the content of this folder to their openBIS via admin UI (see https://openbis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-documentation/general-admin-users/admins-documentation/new-entity-type-registration.html#register-masterdata-via-excel)
